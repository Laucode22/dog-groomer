This project involves the development of a Java Maven and Swing application for a canine grooming salon. It allows for CRUD operations on pets and owners by connecting the application to a MySQL database.

The salon requires a form to store the data of each of its pet clients. Thus, the application should be capable of registering the following data for each pet and its owners:
- Pets: client_number, dog_name, breed, color, special_care, observations
- Owners: owner_id, name, phone_number, address

Additionally, the application offers the option to view information on all pets stored in the database along with their owners. This information is presented in a table format, organized by different fields such as pet name, color, breed, etc.

Furthermore, from this same table, users have the option to edit pet information. Upon selection, the application retrieves all data related to the chosen animal, allowing users to make changes that are subsequently updated in the database.
